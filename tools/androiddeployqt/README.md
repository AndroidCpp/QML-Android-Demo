## androiddeployqt

This tool is copied from **Qt5** and sets up the build directory for being
compressed in a **.apk** file. It uses the *configAndroid.json* file as
input and generates the *AndroidManifest.xml* file. It also copies within the
build directory the Qt5 libraries needed and anything else that **ant** expects
to find.

A very-well structured documentation about this tool's responsability can be
found on [Qt5's page](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/deployment-android.html).
